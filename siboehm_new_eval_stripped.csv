## Description

You are given two integers, `num` and `t`.

An integer `x` is called **achievable** if it can become equal to `num` after
applying the following operation no more than `t` times:

  * Increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.

Return _the maximum possible achievable number_. It can be proven that there
exists at least one achievable number.



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 4, t = 1    Output: 6    Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:    1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.     It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.        

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 3, t = 2    Output: 7    Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num:     1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.    2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.    It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A subarray `s` of length
`m` is called **alternating** if:

  * `m` is greater than `1`.
  * `s1 = s0 + 1`.
  * The **0-indexed** subarray `s` looks like `[s0, s1, s0, s1,...,s(m-1) % 2]`. In other words, `s1 - s0 = 1`, `s2 - s1 = -1`, `s3 - s2 = 1`, `s4 - s3 = -1`, and so on up to `s[m - 1] - s[m - 2] = (-1)m`.

Return _the maximum length of all **alternating** subarrays present in _`nums`
_or_`-1` _if no such subarray exists_ _._

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,3,4,3,4]    Output: 4    Explanation: The alternating subarrays are [3,4], [3,4,3], and [3,4,3,4]. The longest of these is [3,4,3,4], which is of length 4.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [4,5,6]    Output: 2    Explanation: [4,5] and [5,6] are the only two alternating subarrays. They are both of length 2.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `threshold`.

Find the length of the **longest subarray** of `nums` starting at index `l`

following conditions:

  * `nums[l] % 2 == 0`

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices `i`, `j`
where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` is called beautiful if the **first digit** of
`nums[i]` and the **last digit** of `nums[j]` are **coprime**.

Return _the total number of beautiful pairs in_`nums`.

Two integers `x` and `y` are **coprime** if there is no integer greater than 1
that divides both of them. In other words, `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x,
y) == 1`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the **greatest common divisor** of `x` and `y`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]    Output: 5    Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.    When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.    Thus, we return 5.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [11,21,12]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.    Thus, we return 2.

## Description

You are given an integer `n` that consists of exactly `3` digits.

We call the number `n` **fascinating** if, after the following modification,
the resulting number contains all the digits from `1` to `9` **exactly** once
and does not contain any `0`'s:

  * **Concatenate** `n` with the numbers `2 * n` and `3 * n`.

Return `true` _if_`n` _is fascinating, or_`false` _otherwise_.

**Concatenating** two numbers means joining them together. For example, the
concatenation of `121` and `371` is `121371`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 192    Output: true    Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 192 and 2 * n = 384 and 3 * n = 576. The resulting number is 192384576. This number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 100    Output: false    Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 100 and 2 * n = 200 and 3 * n = 300. The resulting number is 100200300. This number does not satisfy any of the conditions.    



**Constraints:**

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** permutation of `n` integers `nums`.

A permutation is called **semi-ordered** if the first number equals `1` and
the last number equals `n`. You can perform the below operation as many times
as you want until you make `nums` a **semi-ordered** permutation:

  * Pick two adjacent elements in `nums`, then swap them.

Return _the minimum number of operations to make_`nums` _a **semi-ordered
permutation**_.

A **permutation** is a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` of length `n`
containing each number exactly once.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,1,4,3]    Output: 2    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:     1 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    2 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than two operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.     

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [2,4,1,3]    Output: 3    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:    1 - swap i = 1 and j = 2. The permutation becomes [2,1,4,3].    2 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    3 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than three operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,5]    Output: 0    Explanation: The permutation is already a semi-ordered permutation.

The remaining elements need to be moved to their correct positions, which can be done by swapping adjacent elements. The minimum number of such operations required is equal to the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Here is the Python code for the problem.

In the code, we first initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n` with all elements as `1`. This is because a single element is always an increasing subsequence of length `1`. Then for each element in the array, we check all the previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element, it means that the current element can be appended to the increasing subsequence ending at the previous element. So, we update the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current element as the maximum of its current length and the length of the increasing subsequence ending at the previous element plus `1`. Finally, we return the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence as the minimum number of operations required to make the permutation semi-ordered.",48.78547787666321,0.04011,20230711,"07/11/2023, 01:47:29",0,"  [38;2;255;0;0m✘ Runtime Error[39m

## Description

Given a **0-indexed** string `s`, repeatedly perform the following operation
**any** number of times:

  * Choose an index `i` in the string, and let `c` be the character in position `i`. **Delete** the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **left** of `i` (if any) and the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **right** of `i` (if any).

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `s` by performing the above
operation any number of times.

Return _an integer denoting the length of the **minimized** string._



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = ""aaabc""    Output: 3    Explanation: In this example, s is ""aaabc"". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes ""abc"". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = ""cbbd""    Output: 3    Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes ""cbd"" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3.     

**Example 3:**
            Input: s = ""dddaaa""    Output: 2    Explanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes ""daaa"". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes ""da"". We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of **uppercase** English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can
remove **any** occurrence of one of the substrings `""AB""` or `""CD""` from `s`.

Return _the **minimum** possible length of the resulting string that you can

**Note** that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could
produce new `""AB""` or `""CD""` substrings.



**Example 1:**

## Description

There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a
circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in **clockwise order**. More formally,
moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for
`1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the
`1st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

`1st` friend receives the ball.

  * After that, `1st` friend passes it to the friend who is `k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `2 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `3 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the `ith` turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it
to the friend who is `i * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise**
direction.

The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.

The **losers** of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the
entire game.

Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return _the array
answer, which contains the losers of the game in the **ascending** order_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 5, k = 2    Output: [4,5]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 2 steps away from them - 3rd friend.    2) 3rd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 2nd friend.    3) 2nd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 6 steps away from them  - 3rd friend.    4) The game ends as 3rd friend receives the ball for the second time.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 4, k = 4    Output: [2,3,4]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at the 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 1st friend.    2) The game ends as 1st friend receives the ball for the second time.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `details`. Each element of
`details` provides information about a given passenger compressed into a
string of length `15`. The system is such that:

  * The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
  * The next character denotes the gender of the person.
  * The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
  * The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.

Return _the number of passengers who are **strictly** **more than 60 years
old**._



**Example 1:**
            Input: details = [""7868190130M7522"",""5303914400F9211"",""9273338290F4010""]    Output: 2    Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: details = [""1313579440F2036"",""2921522980M5644""]    Output: 0    Explanation: None of the passengers are older than 60.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= details.length <= 100`
  * `details[i].length == 15`
  * `details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.`
  * `details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.`

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`.

The **distinct difference** array of `nums` is an array `diff` of length `n`
such that `diff[i]` is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix
`nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]` **subtracted from** the number of distinct elements
in the prefix `nums[0, ..., i]`.

Return _the **distinct difference** array of _`nums`.

Note that `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index
`i` and ending at index `j` inclusive. Particularly, if `i > j` then `nums[i,
..., j]` denotes an empty subarray.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]    Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]    Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.    For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.    For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.    For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.    For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]    Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]    Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.    For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.    For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.    For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.    For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `player1` and `player2`, that
represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game,
respectively.

The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is
exactly `10`.

Assume a player hit `xi` pins in the `ith` turn. The value of the `ith` turn
for the player is:

  * `2xi` if the player hit `10` pins in any of the previous two turns.
  * Otherwise, It is `xi`.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.

Return

  * `1` _if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,_
  * `2` _if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and_
  * `0` _in case of a draw._



**Example 1:**
            Input: player1 = [4,10,7,9], player2 = [6,5,2,3]    Output: 1    Explanation: The score of player1 is 4 + 10 + 2*7 + 2*9 = 46.    The score of player2 is 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16.    Score of player1 is more than the score of player2, so, player1 is the winner, and the answer is 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]    Output: 2    Explanation: The score of player1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.    The score of player2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.    Score of player2 is more than the score of player1, so, player2 is the winner, and the answer is 2.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]    Output: 0    Explanation: The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5    The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5    The score of player1 equals to the score of player2, so, there is a draw, and the answer is 0.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your
task is to perform the following operation **exactly** `k` times in order to
maximize your score:

  1. Select an element `m` from `nums`.
  2. Remove the selected element `m` from the array.
  3. Add a new element with a value of `m + 1` to the array.
  4. Increase your score by `m`.

Return _the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation
exactly_ `k` _times._



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3    Output: 18    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.    For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]    For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]    For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]    So, we will return 18.    It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2    Output: 11    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.    For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]    For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]    So, we will return 11.    It can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.

## Description

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a
train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount
of delay in hours.

Return _the time when the train will arrive at the station._

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.



**Example 1:**
            Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5     Output: 20     Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).    

**Example 2:**
            Input: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11    Output: 0    Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`.

The **divisibility score** of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices `j` such
that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`.

Return _the integer_ `divisors[i]` _with the maximum divisibility score_. If
there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of
them.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]    Output: 3    Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:    The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 5.    The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since nums[0] is divisible by 2.    The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3], and nums[4] are divisible by 3.    Since divisors[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [5,7,5]    Output: 5    Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:    The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.    The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 7.    The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.    Since divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[2] all have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[2]).    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [12], divisors = [10,16]    Output: 10    Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:    The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 10.    The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 16.    Since divisors[0] and divisors[1] both have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[0]).

## Description

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, find the **0-indexed** position of the
row that contains the **maximum** count of **ones,** and the number of ones in
that row.

In case there are multiple rows that have the maximum count of ones, the row
with the **smallest row number** should be selected.

Return _an array containing the index of the row, and the number of ones in
it._



**Example 1:**
            Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]    Output: [0,1]    Explanation: Both rows have the same number of 1's. So we return the index of the smaller row, 0, and the maximum count of ones (1). So, the answer is [0,1].     

**Example 2:**
            Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1]]    Output: [1,2]    Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So we return its index, 1, and the count. So, the answer is [1,2].    

**Example 3:**
            Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,0]]    Output: [1,2]    Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So the answer is [1,2].

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a
column is the maximum **length** of its integers.

  * For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is of length `3`.

Return _an integer array_ `ans` _of size_ `n` _where_ `ans[i]` _is the width

The **length** of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is
non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.



**Example 1:**
            Input: grid = [[1],[22],[333]]    Output: [3]    Explanation: In the 0th column, 333 is of length 3.

Note that:

  * An integer is **prime** if it is greater than `1` and has no positive integer divisors other than `1` and itself.
  * An integer `val` is on one of the **diagonals** of `nums` if there exists an integer `i` for which `nums[i][i] = val` or an `i` for which `nums[i][nums.length - i - 1] = val`.

## Description

There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number `1`, `0`, or
`-1` written on it.

You are given four **non-negative** integers `numOnes`, `numZeros`,
`numNegOnes`, and `k`.

The bag initially contains:

  * `numOnes` items with `1`s written on them.
  * `numZeroes` items with `0`s written on them.
  * `numNegOnes` items with `-1`s written on them.

We want to pick exactly `k` items among the available items. Return _the
**maximum** possible sum of numbers written on the items_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 2    Output: 2    Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 2 items with 1 written on them and get a sum in a total of 2.    It can be proven that 2 is the maximum possible sum.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 4    Output: 3    Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 3 items with 1 written on them, and 1 item with 0 written on it, and get a sum in a total of 3.    It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible sum.    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes <= 50`
  * `0 <= k <= numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes`

## Description

You are given an integer `money` denoting the amount of money (in dollars)
that you have and another integer `children` denoting the number of children
that you must distribute the money to.

You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:

  * All money must be distributed.
  * Everyone must receive at least `1` dollar.
  * Nobody receives `4` dollars.

Return _the **maximum** number of children who may receive **exactly** _`8`
_dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules_.
If there is no way to distribute the money, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: money = 20, children = 3    Output: 1    Explanation:     The maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:    - 8 dollars to the first child.    - 9 dollars to the second child.     - 3 dollars to the third child.    It can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: money = 16, children = 2    Output: 2    Explanation: Each child can be given 8 dollars.

You are given a **0-indexed** array of string `words` and two integers `left`
and `right`.

A string is called a **vowel string** if it starts with a vowel character and
ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`,
`'o'`, and `'u'`.

Return _the number of vowel strings_`words[i]` _where_`i` _belongs to the

            Input: words = [""are"",""amy"",""u""], left = 0, right = 2    Output: 2    Explanation:     - ""are"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.    - ""amy"" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.    - ""u"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.    The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""hey"",""aeo"",""mu"",""ooo"",""artro""], left = 1, right = 4    Output: 3    Explanation:     - ""aeo"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.    - ""mu"" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.    - ""ooo"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.    - ""artro"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.

## Description

You are given two **2D** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2.`

  * `nums1[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.
  * `nums2[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.

Each array contains **unique** ids and is sorted in **ascending** order by id.

Merge the two arrays into one array that is sorted in ascending order by id,
respecting the following conditions:

  * Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
  * Each id should be included **only once** and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays then its value in that array is considered to be `0`.

Return _the resulting array_. The returned array must be sorted in ascending
order by id.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,5]], nums2 = [[1,4],[3,2],[4,1]]    Output: [[1,6],[2,3],[3,2],[4,6]]    Explanation: The resulting array contains the following:    - id = 1, the value of this id is 2 + 4 = 6.    - id = 2, the value of this id is 3.    - id = 3, the value of this id is 2.    - id = 4, the value of this id is 5 + 1 = 6.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [[2,4],[3,6],[5,5]], nums2 = [[1,3],[4,3]]    Output: [[1,3],[2,4],[3,6],[4,3],[5,5]]    Explanation: There are no common ids, so we just include each id with its value in the resulting list.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 200`
  * `nums1[i].length == nums2[j].length == 2`
  * `1 <= idi, vali <= 1000`
  * Both arrays contain unique ids.
  * Both arrays are in strictly ascending order by id.

## Description

You are given an integer `num`. You know that Danny Mittal will sneakily
**remap** one of the `10` possible digits (`0` to `9`) to another digit.

Return _the difference between the maximum and minimum_ _  values Danny can
make by remapping  **exactly** **one** digit_ _in_`num`.

**Notes:**

  * When Danny remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Danny replaces all occurrences of `d1` in `num` with `d2`.
  * Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.
  * Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
  * The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.
  * We mentioned ""Danny Mittal"" to congratulate him on being in the top 10 in Weekly Contest 326.



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 11891    Output: 99009    Explanation:     To achieve the maximum value, Danny can remap the digit 1 to the digit 9 to yield 99899.    To achieve the minimum value, Danny can remap the digit 1 to the digit 0, yielding 890.    The difference between these two numbers is 99009.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 90    Output: 99    Explanation:    The maximum value that can be returned by the function is 99 (if 0 is replaced by 9) and the minimum value that can be returned by the function is 0 (if 9 is replaced by 0).    Thus, we return 99.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **concatenation** of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating
their numerals.

  * For example, the concatenation of `15`, `49` is `1549`.

The **concatenation value** of `nums` is initially equal to `0`. Perform this
operation until `nums` becomes empty:

  * If there exists more than one number in `nums`, pick the first element and last element in `nums` respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete the first and last element from `nums`.
  * If one element exists, add its value to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete it.

Return _the concatenation value of the`nums`_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]    Output: 596    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.    Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.    Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.    Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.    Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [5,14,13,8,12]    Output: 673    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.    Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.    Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].     - In the third operation:    nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.    Then we delete it from nums, so nums become empty.    Since the concatenation value is 673 so the answer is 673.

## Description

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various
piles. Every second, you do the following:

  * Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
  * If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
  * Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return _the number of gifts remaining after_`k` _seconds._



**Example 1:**
            Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4    Output: 29    Explanation:     The gifts are taken in the following way:    - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.    - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.    - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.    - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.    The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4    Output: 4    Explanation:     In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile.     That is, you can't take any pile with you.     So, the total gifts remaining are 4.

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board.
Every day, for `109` days, you perform the following procedure:

  * For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.
  * Then, place those numbers on the board.

Return _the number of **distinct** integers present on the board after_ `109`
_days have elapsed_.

**Note:**

  * Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
  * `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 5    Output: 4    Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board.     The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1.     After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1.     At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5.

## Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order,
return _the **minimum integer common** to both arrays_. If there is no common
integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`.

Note that an integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both
arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]    Output: 2    Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`
  * Both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Description

Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the
dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the
**category** of the box_.

  * The box is `""Bulky""` if:     * **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to `104`.    * Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to `109`.
  * If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `""Heavy"".`
  * If the box is both `""Bulky""` and `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Both""`.
  * If the box is neither `""Bulky""` nor `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Neither""`.
  * If the box is `""Bulky""` but not `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Bulky""`.
  * If the box is `""Heavy""` but not `""Bulky""`, then its category is `""Heavy""`.

**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and
height.



**Example 1:**
            Input: length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300    Output: ""Heavy""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.     Its volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    However mass >= 100, so the box is ""Heavy"".    Since the box is not ""Bulky"" but ""Heavy"", we return ""Heavy"".

**Example 2:**
            Input: length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50    Output: ""Neither""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.    Its volume = 8 * 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    Its mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as ""Heavy"" either.     Since its neither of the two above categories, we return ""Neither"".

  * Formally, the next element of `words[i]` is `words[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `words[i]` is `words[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, where `n` is the length of `words`.

Starting from `startIndex`, you can move to either the next word or the
previous word with `1` step at a time.

Return _the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string_ `target`. If the
string `target` does not exist in `words`, return `-1`.

The shortest distance to reach ""hello"" is 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""leetcode""], target = ""leetcode"", startIndex = 0    Output: 1    Explanation: We start from index 0 and can reach ""leetcode"" by    - moving 2 units to the right to reach index 3.    - moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 3.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `forts` of length `n` representing
the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:

  * `-1` represents there is **no fort** at the `ith` position.
  * `0` indicates there is an **enemy** fort at the `ith` position.
  * `1` indicates the fort at the `ith` the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i`
to an empty position `j` such that:

  * `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`
  * The army travels over enemy forts **only**. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0.`

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are
**captured**.

Return _the **maximum** number of enemy forts that can be captured_. In case
it is **impossible** to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your
command, return `0` _._



**Example 1:**
            Input: forts = [1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1]    Output: 4    Explanation:    - Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.    - Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.    Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: forts = [0,0,1,-1]    Output: 0    Explanation: Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.

class Solution(object):
    def captureForts(self, forts):
        """"""
        :type forts: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """"""
        max_captured = 0
        start = -1
        captured = 0
        for i in range(len(forts)):
            if forts[i] == 1:
                if start != -1:
                    max_captured = max(max_captured, captured)
                start = i
                captured = 0
            elif forts[i] == 0 and start != -1:
                captured += 1
        return max_captured

In this code, we iterate over the array of forts. If we find a fort under our command (forts[i] == 1), we check if we have started a segment of enemy forts (start != -1). If we have, we update the maximum number of captured forts (max_captured) with the number of enemy forts in the current segment (captured). Then, we start a new segment of enemy forts (start = i) and reset the counter (captured = 0). If we find an enemy fort (forts[i] == 0) and we have started a segment of enemy forts (start != -1), we increment the counter (captured += 1). Finally, we return the maximum number of captured forts.",40.96598267555237,0.03822,20230711,"07/11/2023, 01:54:45",0,"  [38;2;255;0;0m✘ Runtime Error[39m

    The idea is to find the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured by moving the army from one of your forts to another. This can be achieved by using two pointers to keep track of the start and end of the current segment of enemy forts, and a counter to keep track of the number of enemy forts in the current segment.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`.

Two strings are **similar** if they consist of the same characters.

  * For example, `""abca""` and `""cba""` are similar since both consist of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
  * However, `""abacba""` and `""bcfd""` are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return _the number of pairs_`(i, j)` _such that_`0 <= i < j <= word.length -
1` _and the two strings_`words[i]` _and_`words[j]` _are similar_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: words = [""aba"",""aabb"",""abcd"",""bac"",""aabc""]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are 2 pairs that satisfy the conditions:    - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.     - i = 3 and j = 4 : both words[3] and words[4] only consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.     

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""aabb"",""ab"",""ba""]    Output: 3    Explanation: There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:    - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.     - i = 0 and j = 2 : both words[0] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.    - i = 1 and j = 2 : both words[1] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: words = [""nba"",""cba"",""dba""]    Output: 0    Explanation: Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
  * `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:

  * Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
  * Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.

**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return _the answer after performing the operations described above_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex1.jpg)
            Input: grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]    Output: 8    Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.    - In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.    - In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.    - In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.    The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex2.jpg)
            Input: grid = [[10]]    Output: 10    Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.    - In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.    The final answer = 10.    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 50`
  * `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
